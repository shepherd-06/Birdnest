# BirdNest 🐦
This project is a pre-assignment for Reaktor Summer Trainee. Details of the assignment can be found at Reaktor Assignments.

Project URL: https://magenta-pika-11ca8c.netlify.app/

## Objective 🎯
Build and deploy a web application which lists all the pilots who recently violated the NDZ perimeter.

What it looks like is up to you, but this list should:

* Persist the pilots' information for 10 minutes since their drone was last seen by the equipment
* Display the closest confirmed distance to the nest 📏
* Contains the pilot's name, email address, and phone number 📇
* Immediately show the information from the last 10 minutes to anyone opening the application
* Not require the user to manually refresh the view to see up-to-date information

⚠️ **Backend URL Taken Offline**: Please note that the backend URL provided in the assignment [https://assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/](https://assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/) has been taken offline.
